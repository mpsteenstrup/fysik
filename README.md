<Question question="Suppose a neuron in the second layer has weights as indicated above. Rank the four images (A, B, C, and D) based on how much they would activate that neuron:" choice1="A > B > C > D" choice2="B > D > A > C" choice3="B > D > C > A" choice4="D > C > B > A" answer={2}>
  B gives the highest activation because it only activates the neurons with
  positive weights. C gives the lowest activation because it is the exact
  inverse of B. A has a weighted sum of zero because all the input neurons are
  off, but D has a positive activation because it activates 24 positive weights
  but only 16 negative weights.
